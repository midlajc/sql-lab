-- Prepare a salary report of the employees showing the details such as:
-- EmpNo, Name, Basic Pay, DA, Gross Salary, PF, Net Salary, Annual Salary and Tax
-- For this purpose, create a table named SALARIES having the following structure.

-- Field Name Type Width
-- EmpNo Character 10
-- Name Character 20
-- Basic Numeric 6

-- Enter the records of at least 10 employees. Use the following information for calculating the
-- details for the report:
-- DA is fixed as the 40% of the basic pay.
-- PF is fixed as 10% of the basic pay.
-- Gross Salary is (Basic Pay + DA).
-- Net Salary is (Gross Salary â€“ PF)
-- Annual Salary is (12 * Net Salary)

-- Tax is calculated using the following rules:
-- If annual salary is less than 100000, No Tax
-- If annual salary is greater than 100000 but less than or equal to 150000, then the tax is 10%
-- of the excess over 100000.
-- If annual salary is greater than 150000 but less than or equal to 250000, then the tax is 20%
-- of the excess over 150000.
-- If annual salary is greater than 250000, then the tax is 30% of the excess over 250000.
